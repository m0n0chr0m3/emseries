# EmSeries

EmSeries is an Embedded Time Series database. Designed for small-scale applications, it is meant to handle time series data in much he same way that sqlite handles SQL data.

The project has so far only been outlined. Upcoming expected features:

*   indexing based on time
*   indexing based on tags (like Influx)
*   databases larger than memory
*   out of order data arrival
*   multi-process safety

The actual extent of the features implemened will depend on how I and any others decide to use them.

This library is already available for basic create/read/update/delete usage.
